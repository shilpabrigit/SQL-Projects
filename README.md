This SQL project focusses on identifying how some factors from different domains have contributed to attrition

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset 

OBSERVATIONS:
It is noted that the percentage of attritions department wise is not uniform.
Higher attritions are seen in R & D department.
This could be related to overtime
The Monthly income of the attritted are lower as compared to non attritted.
This is explained by the years of experience or years at work with company.
Lab technicians are the highest percentage among attritted.
The work environment satisfaction among the attritted is low.
Most attritions are seen in the age group 27-35



POSSIBLE SUGESSTIONS:
 HR department should attempt to study why there is gap in the percentage of overtime between attritted and non attritted.
Job performance of the attritted can be compared against the non attritted to study how environment satisfaction has impacted the performance.
The cause of high number of exits from lab technician role should be studied further in comparison with the field of education.
